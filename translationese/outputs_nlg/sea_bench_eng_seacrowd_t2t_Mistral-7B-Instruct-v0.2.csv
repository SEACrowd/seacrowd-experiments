"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: How far would you be willing to go to satisfy your need to know?Far enough to find out your possibility of dying from a terrible disease?These days that's more than an academic question,as Tracy Smith reports in our Cover Story. There are now more than a thousand genetic  tests,for everything from baldness to breast cancer,and the list is growing.Question is,do you really want to know what might eventually kill you?For instance,Nobel Prizewinning scientist James Watson,one of the first people to map their entire genetic makeup,is said to have asked not to be told if he were at a higher risk for Alzheimer's . \If I tell you that you have an increased risk of getting a terrible disease,that could weigh on your mind and make you anxious,through which you see the rest of your life as you wait for that disease to hit you.It could really mess you up."" said Dr.Robert Green,a Harvard geneticist. ""Every ache and pain,"" Smith suggested,could be understood as ""the beginning of the end.""""That's right.If you ever worried you were at risk for Alzheimer's disease,then every time you can't find your car in the parking lot,you think the disease has started."" Dr.Green has been thinking about this issue for years.He led a study of people who wanted to know if they were at a higher genetic risk for Alzheimer's.It was thought that people who got bad news would,for lack of a better medical term, _ .But Green and his team found that there was ""no significant difference"" between how people handled good news and possibly the worst news of their lives.In fact,most people think they can handle it.People who ask for the information usually can handle the information,good or bad,said Green. Question: Which of the following is TRUE of James Watson? - He is strongly in favor of the present genetic tests. - He is more likely to suffer from Alzheimer's disease. - He believes genetic mapping can help cure any disease. - He doesn't want to know his chance of getting a disease.
""","He doesn't want to know his chance of getting a disease."" This is the correct answer. James Watson was one of the first people to map their entire genetic makeup, but when asked if he wanted to be told if he were at a higher risk for Alzheimer's, he refused. He believed that being told he had an increased risk could weigh on his mind and make him anxious as he waited for the disease to hit him.","He doesn't want to know his chance of getting a disease.""

"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Memory is the ability to keep track of things that have happened in the past. Memory really is learning. One needs memory to ride a bicycle. A dog needs to remember if it is to come when called. Memory is said to be stored in the brain as a \memory trace ."" What makes up this trace is not known. Some scientists believe that certain chemical substances may carry certain memories. For example, one substance, when given to rats, causes them to fear the dark. Other research into memory has to do with how the brain works. Psychologists use three means to find out how a person remembers. For example, give a person a grocery list. Let the person memorize the list, then put it away. The most natural way to find out how much a person remembers of the grocery list is to ask what he or she remembers. This is called the method of recall. Another method is called recognition. Give the person another grocery list. Ask him or her to choose items on the first list from the items that are on only the second list. Often a person will be able to recognize things that he or she cannot recall. A third method of finding how much a person remembers is called relearning. Here the person is asked to read over the first list. The person will probably learn the list the second time faster than he did the first time. The difference in the time it takes to relearn the list is thought of as a measure of how much a person has remembered. One way of remembering something is to repeat it many times. Interest is very important. Boring lists of facts are much more difficult to remember than something that we understand and are interested in. Motivation, or wanting to do something, is also important. Motivation is linked with reward. For example, a hungry animal quickly learns how to do something if that action gets the animal food. In humans, wanting to learn is often motivation. The praise of a teacher or the knowledge that an answer is correct is rewarding. Question: A good way to train an animal to do something quickly is to   _  . Answer:

Possible answers:
+ make the action easy;
+ praise it in words;
+ reward it with food;
+ weaken its motivation;
Answer:""","reward it with food.""

Explanation:
The article explains that motivation plays a key role in learning and memory. One of the ways to motivate an animal to learn or remember something quickly is by providing it with a reward, such as food. This can create a desire for the animal to repeat the behavior, making it much more likely for the behavior to be memorized or learned.","reward it with food.""

"Question: At first, the earth's surface layer   was made up of huge blocks of hard, solid rocks. Then slowly, the rocks broke up into smaller and smaller pieces. Finally stones, pebbles   and grains of sand were formed. Many sorts of plants and animals lived and died on the surface of the earth. Their remains mixed up with the stones, pebbles and formed soil. The outmost layer of the earth is soil. There are many ways in which large pieces of rock break into smaller ones. Wind, water, heat and cold help to break up rocks. When winds blow grains of sand against a large rock for a long time, the softer layers of the rock are slowly worn away. These leave holes and cracks in the rock, which become bigger and finally the rock breaks up into smaller pieces. The moving water of streams and rivers also helps to break up rocks. As the water moves along, it carries with it small pieces of rock. These rub the larger ones. Thus, the larger rocks are worn down to smaller pieces. The heat of the sun is also helpful to breaking up rocks. When the sun shines, the rocks become very hot. If these rocks are suddenly cooled, they may crack. Ice also plays a part in making soil. Water in the cracks can turn into ice in cold weather. As this happens, it becomes bigger and the cracks become wider, and finally break into smaller pieces. Which of the following speeds up  the breaks of rocks most? A) Hot weather. B) Cold water. C) Sharp changes in temperature. D) More dead plants in the cracks.
Answer:",C) Sharp changes in temperature.,C) Sharp changes in temperature.,
"There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (instead of 5 yards (4.6 m) in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.

The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (coin flips in this case), each with the same probability of success (p = 0.5 for a fair coin).

The formula for the probability of a specific number of successes (X)",

"You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.

You are given a collection of `rods` that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of lengths `1`, `2`, and `3`, you can weld them together to make a support of length `6`.

Return _the largest possible height of your billboard installation_. If you cannot support the billboard, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rods = \[1,2,3,6\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rods = \[1,2,3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** We have two disjoint subsets {2,3,5} and {4,6}, which have the same sum = 10.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** rods = \[1,2\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The billboard cannot be supported, so we return 0.

"During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?

The Hubble Space Telescope, named for twentieth-century American astronomer Edwin Hubble, is an awesome telescope. NASA began building the telescope in 1977 after Congress gave the go-ahead on the project. In 1990, the space shuttle Discovery crew finally positioned the telescope some 370 miles above Earth. Unfortunately, a defect caused it to produce fuzzy images, but ever since repairs were made by astronauts from the space shuttle Endeavour in 1993, it has taken some pretty great pictures.

Recent studies indicate that people who spend significant time browsing the World Wide Web do so at the expense of time spent in face-to-face interaction with other people. This has led some to fear that social isolation will greatly increase because of the popularity of browsing the Web. But, since browsing the Web is just one of many popular solitary activities, and any time spent on a solitary activity is time spent not interacting face-to-face with other people, such fears are unwarranted. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the view that social isolation will greatly increase because of the popularity of browsing the Web?
A: It is a premise that, together with another premise, is meant to support the conclusion of the argument.
B: It is the overall conclusion of the argument.

"Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.

The waters off the coast of Iceland are filled with pods of killer whales, which migrate there during the summer. Wildlife parks that rely on the killer whales for entertainment hunt the killer whale almost exclusively in the water of Iceland, because strict sanctions forbid them from doing so off the coast of North America, an area also abundant in killer whales. Since Iceland recently gave into pressure from international groups opposed to the hunting of killer whales, it too will forbid the hunting of killer whales off its coast. Ttherefore, all wildlife parks will be forced to end their shows featuring killer whales once their current killer whales are unable to perform. All of the following cast doubt on the conclusion of the argument EXCEPT?
A: The recent ban only extends to within one hundred miles of Iceland, though killer whales are plentiful along the shores of Greenland, which fall outside this range.
B: In-park killer whale births have become increasingly common, especially in those wildlife parks that harbor a large number of killer whales.
C: The incoming prime minister of Canada, who is more conservative, is planning on lifting the ban on hunting killer whales off the coast of Canada.
D: It is nearly impossible to catch killer whales in deep waters, so hunters typically rely on luring killer whales into coves.","

The argument does not explicitly state that the ban on hunting killer whales off Icelandic waters applies to all of its waters. The assumption that such a ban applies to all of Iceland's waters is reasonable but unstated. Hence, a possible objection to the conclusion would be if there were other areas within Iceland's jurisdiction, such as Greenland where waters fall outside the range of the ban, where the wildlife parks could continue their shows featuring","
