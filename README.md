# SEACrowd Experiments

Experiment repository for the ["SEACrowd: A Multilingual Multimodal Data Hub and Benchmark Suite for Southeast Asian Languages"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10118) paper.

SEACrowd is a [collaborative initiative](https://github.com/SEACrowd) that consolidates a [comprehensive resource hub](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-catalogue/) that fills the resource gap by [providing standardized corpora](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub) in nearly 1,000 Southeast Asian (SEA) languages across three modalities.

## SEACrowd Benchmarks: State-of-the-Art Models on SEA Languages

Placed under [`evaluation/`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/tree/main/evaluation).

Through our SEACrowd benchmarks, we assess the quality of AI models on 36 indigenous languages across 13 tasks, offering valuable insights into the current AI landscape in SEA. Furthermore, we propose strategies to facilitate greater AI advancements, maximizing potential utility and resource equity for the future of AI in SEA.

To run a model on our benchmark, simply take add the relevant model to our evaluation script(s):
- NLU
    - [`evaluation/run_nlu_prompt_batch.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_nlu_prompt.sh) for open-source models
    - [`evaluation/run_nlu_prompt_batch_commercial.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_nlu_prompt_commercial.sh) for commercial (API-based) models
- NLG
    - [`evaluation/run_nlg_prompt_batch.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_nlg_prompt.sh) for open-source models
    - [`evaluation/run_nlg_prompt_batch_commercial.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_nlg_prompt_commercial.sh) for commercial (API-based) models
- Speech
    - [`evaluation/run_speech_mms.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_speech_mms.sh) for MMS-based models
    - [`evaluation/run_speech_seamless.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_speech_seamless.sh) for Seamless-based models
    - [`evaluation/run_speech_wav2vec2_xlsr.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_speech_wav2vec2_xlsr.sh) for Wav2Vec2-based models
    - [`evaluation/run_speech_whisper.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_speech_seamless.sh) for Whisper-based models
- Vision-language
    - [`evaluation/run_vl_prompt.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/evaluation/run_vl_prompt.sh)

The evaluation run will create a log in `evaluation/outputs_*/` directory to record the model predictions/generations, and finally a summary of the performance measures per data subset in `evaluation/metrics_*/`.

## Generation Quality in SEA Languages: Translationese vs. Natural

Placed under [`translationese/`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/translationese/).

To analyze the generation quality of LLMs in SEA languages, we build a text classifier to discriminate between translationese and natural texts. We construct a translationese classification training and testing dataset using 49 and 62 data subsets, respectively, covering approximately 39.9k and 51.5k sentences across 9 SEA languages: English (eng), Indonesian (ind), Khmer (khm), Lao (lao), Burmese (mya), Filipino (fil), Thai (tha), Vietnamese (vie), and Malay (zlm).

To fine-tune the translationese classifier, execute [`translationese/run.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/translationese/run.sh). We use a binary label (translationese, i.e., machine-translated or human-translated, or natural, i.e., human-generated) instead of 3 labels (machine-translated, human-translated, human-generated).

> Our fine-tuned mDEBERTA SEA translationese classifier is available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/SEACrowd/mdeberta-v3_sea_translationese)!

To obtain the model generations for the naturalness analysis, execute [`translationese/run_nlg_prompt.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/translationese/run_nlg_prompt.sh) for open-source models and [`translationese/run_nlg_prompt_commercial.sh`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/translationese/run_nlg_prompt_commercial.sh) for commercial models.

To classify the model generations, check out [`translationese/analyze_translationese.ipynb`](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments/blob/main/translationese/analyze_translationese.ipynb).
