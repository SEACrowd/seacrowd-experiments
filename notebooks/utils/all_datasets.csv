This dataset enables the evaluation of mono- and multi-lingual models in high-, medium-, and low-resource languages. Each question has four multiple-choice answers and is linked to a short passage from the FLORES-200 dataset. The human annotation procedure was carefully curated to create questions that discriminate between different levels of generalizable language comprehension and is reinforced by extensive quality checks. While all questions directly relate to the passage, the English dataset on its own proves difficult enough to challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, this dataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. Belebele opens up new avenues for evaluating and analyzing the multilingual abilities of language models and NLP systems.",https://github.com/facebookresearch/belebele,https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/belebele,"ceb

This is a subset of Glot2000-c, based on a minimum number of sentences (30,000) exclusion criterion. This corpus is about 600 GB in size and contains about 1.5 billion sentences. The data is obtained in part by crawling data from websites and by compiling existing datasets. This means there may be overlap with other SEACrowd datasets. It also means that the licenses may be different for each of the underlying datasets, and some of the datasets will require specific registration and/or access requests. The work also contains several benchmarks and evaluation tasks on which Glot500-m is evaluated.",https://github.com/cisnlp/Glot500,https://huggingface.co/datasets/cis-lmu/Glot500,"bsb

We observe that Tatoeba has similar types of high-quality sentences like TALPCo has, albeit shorter. Therefore we choose TALPCo to be in the validation and test sets instead, because longer sentences mean more difficult and meaningful evaluation.

The Tatoeba dataset contains short sentences. However, they contain high-quality full-sentence pairs with precise translation and is widely used in previous work in other languages (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019b).

These articles are different from news as they are not in a formal, informative style. Instead, they are written to advocate and inspire religious values, often times citing biblical or quranic anecdotes. 

The Tanzil dataset is a Quran translation dataset which has a
relatively-imbalanced sentence length between the two languages, evidenced in Table 2, where an average Indonesian
sentence in this dataset is about 50% longer than an average English one. Furthermore, an average pair of sentences
in this dataset would, on average, have one of them twice
as long as the other. However, we still decide to include
the dataset in the domain to avoid overfitting because the
remaining datasets are all about Christianity.
Another interesting property in the religion domain corpus
is the localized names, for example, David to Daud, Mary
to Maryam, Gabriel to Jibril, and more. In contrast, entity
names are usually kept unchanged in other domains.
We also find quite a handful of Indonesian translations of
JW300 are missing the end sentence dot (.), even though
the end sentence dot is present in their English counterpart.
Lastly, we also find some inconsistency in the transliteration, for example praying is sometimes written as ”salat” or
”shalat”, or repentance as ”tobat” or ”taubat”.",https://github.com/gunnxx/indonesian-mt-data/tree/master/religious,-,"eng

Pronoun substitutes are very common in languages in SEA, Japan and Korea, but extremely limited elsewhere.

The Common subset is based on a common questionnaire.  It provides information about whether a given concept (e.g. 'child') can be used as 1st person, 2nd person, title and address term.  If the use exists, example sentences are also given.

The Annotations subset contains annotation of 1st and 2nd person expressions, including both personal pronouns and pronoun substitutes, and address terms.  The corpora used differ from language to language.  However, the annotation scheme is the same across languages.",https://github.com/matbahasa/ProSub,,"zsm
