This dataset enables the evaluation of mono- and multi-lingual models in high-, medium-, and low-resource languages. Each question has four multiple-choice answers and is linked to a short passage from the FLORES-200 dataset. The human annotation procedure was carefully curated to create questions that discriminate between different levels of generalizable language comprehension and is reinforced by extensive quality checks. While all questions directly relate to the passage, the English dataset on its own proves difficult enough to challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, this dataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. Belebele opens up new avenues for evaluating and analyzing the multilingual abilities of language models and NLP systems.",https://github.com/facebookresearch/belebele,https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/belebele,"ceb

This dataset contains primarily short segments: 93% single tokens, and only 23 sentences (0.6%) have over 5 tokens. As such it is best thought of as a multilingual lexicon, rather than a parallel training corpus. The source text is frequent words in the English Language, along with some common phrases and short sentences. Care has been taken to ensure that they include good coverage of numbers, months, days of the week, swadesh words, and names of the languages themselves (including the endonym).",https://github.com/google-research/url-nlp/blob/main/gatitos/README.md,,"ace

For the general domain, we mix shorter sentences from TALPCo and the longer ones from Wikimatrix as our validation and test data. We observe that Tatoeba has similar types of high-quality sentences like TALPCo has, albeit shorter. Therefore we choose TALPCo to be in the validation and test sets instead, because longer sentences mean more difficult and meaningful evaluation.

The Tatoeba dataset contains short sentences. However, they contain high-quality full-sentence pairs with precise translation and is widely used in previous work in other languages (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019b). Due to its simplicity, we do not use Tatoeba as our test and validation sets.

174,Indonesian religious domain MT En-Id,,,"Religious domain consists of religious manuscripts or articles. These articles are different from news as they are not in a formal, informative style. Instead, they are written to advocate and inspire religious values, often times citing biblical or quranic anecdotes. 

The Tanzil dataset is a Quran translation dataset which has a
relatively-imbalanced sentence length between the two languages, evidenced in Table 2, where an average Indonesian
sentence in this dataset is about 50% longer than an average English one. Furthermore, an average pair of sentences
in this dataset would, on average, have one of them twice
as long as the other. However, we still decide to include
the dataset in the domain to avoid overfitting because the
remaining datasets are all about Christianity.
Another interesting property in the religion domain corpus
is the localized names, for example, David to Daud, Mary
to Maryam, Gabriel to Jibril, and more. In contrast, entity
names are usually kept unchanged in other domains.
We also find quite a handful of Indonesian translations of
JW300 are missing the end sentence dot (.), even though
the end sentence dot is present in their English counterpart.
Lastly, we also find some inconsistency in the transliteration, for example praying is sometimes written as ”salat” or
”shalat”, or repentance as ”tobat” or ”taubat”.",https://github.com/gunnxx/indonesian-mt-data/tree/master/religious,-,"eng

Notably, 15,51% of these tokens represent named entities, falling into three distinct categories: hard skill, soft skill, and technology. To construct this dataset, data were gathered from a job portal and subsequently processed using open-source libraries. Given the scarcity of annotated corpora for Indonesian, NERSkill.Id fills a significant void and offers immense value to multiple stakeholders. NLP researchers can harness the dataset's richness to advance skill entity recognition technology in the Indonesian language. Companies and recruiters can benefit by employing NERSkill.Id to enhance talent acquisition and job matching processes through accurate skill identification. Furthermore, educational institutions can leverage the dataset to adapt their courses and training programs to meet the evolving needs of the job market. This dataset can be effectively utilized for training and evaluating named entity recognition systems, empowering advancements in skill entity recognition for the Indonesian language.",https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5s8r9ndfvc/1,,ind,Indonesia,Named Entity Recognition,Language,"General

Pronoun substitutes are very common in languages in SEA, Japan and Korea, but extremely limited elsewhere.

The Common subset is based on a common questionnaire.  It provides information about whether a given concept (e.g. 'child') can be used as 1st person, 2nd person, title and address term.  If the use exists, example sentences are also given.

The Annotations subset contains annotation of 1st and 2nd person expressions, including both personal pronouns and pronoun substitutes, and address terms.  The corpora used differ from language to language.  However, the annotation scheme is the same across languages.",https://github.com/matbahasa/ProSub,,"zsm

MADLAD uses all snapshots of CommonCrawl available as of August 1, 2022. The primary advantage of this dataset over similar datasets is that it is more multilingual, it is audited and more highly filtered, and it is document-level. The main disadvantage is also its strength -- being more filtered, it may lack the recall needed for some applications.",https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/MADLAD-400,https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/MADLAD-400,"ace
